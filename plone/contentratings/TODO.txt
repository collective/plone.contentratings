To Do
======

* Add mechanism to make it easy to create indexes for specific aspects of
  rating categories (e.g., (avg rating, number of ratings), users who
  have rated an object, ....  This probably needs some infrastructure
  support in Plone (e.g. a more flexible implementation of the
  IIndexableObjectWrapper stuff).

* Aggregate statistics across multiple rating categories and a user
  interface for displaying them.  This probably requires some support
  in the underlying contentratings package, and may be best left to
  individual applications using this infrastructure.
